After down-sampling our image and viewing the artifacts one may wish to reconstruct the original image. Unfortunately, due to the new image having only 1/3 the size of the orignal it is impossible to reconstruct the full detail from earlier without some level of guess work. 

Two seperate methods were used in our reconstrction of the original image the first of which was zero-hold interpolation. Zero Hold interpolation is the simplest method of adding new pixels as it will  take the original image and stretch out the last known sampled location in both directions until reaching a new sample point. This creates an image with no "new" information than the original down sampled image, however it leaves sharp edges and jagged lines.

The other method of interpolation used was linear interpolation. Linear interpolation rather than using only the original values for pixels will create new values aiming for a smoother gradient between spots on the image. This creates a smoothing "blur" effect making images more realisitc looking than zero-hold interpolation however, the new information added by this blurring can distort some of what was present in the original image and create odd artifiacts.
