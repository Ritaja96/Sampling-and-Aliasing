3.1	Down-Sampling

(a)	Figure 1 shows the original image next to the down-sampled image. The down-sampled image is the one of the right of the figure. Figure 2 is just of the original image and the Figure 3 is just of the down-sample image. The aliasing is most noticeable on the white fence in the right-hand side of the image. The aliasing is also very apparent on the walls of the buildings next to the lighthouse. Visually this aliasing appears as a moiré pattern. This phenomenon appears as geometric artifacts that do not actually exist in the image. Edges are also a lot starker and rougher in the aliased photo. For example, when looking at the side of the lighthouse where it meets the sky, the interfaces between the two has more defined pixel transitions where the non-aliased photo has a smoother transition between these interfaces. 

(b)	The highest frequency of the fence that is most apparently aliased appears to be 2 pixels per cycle (from fence post to fence post). This is right on the edge of what the Nyquist frequency for capturing the fence. With down sampling the photo by a factor of two, this is placing the sampling frequency below what can properly capture the fence. This distortion in the detail creates these geometric artifacts known as moiré patterns.
